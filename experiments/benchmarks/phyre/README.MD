# APEX on Phyre

This repository contains scripts to test the **APEX structure** on the [Phyre](https://github.com/facebookresearch/phyre) environment.

## Environment

- **Python**: 3.6  
- **OS**: Ubuntu (tested)

## Contents

- Core scripts to run experiments with APEX on Phyre.
- Results are stored in the `results/` folder.  
- Some variant scripts (e.g., replacing the LLM with Claude or DeepSeek) are not included in this repo, but their **results are preserved** in the `results/` directory for reference.

## Notes

- The repository focuses on the structure and evaluation of APEX rather than maintaining all script variants.
- If you need to reproduce specific variants, please adapt the provided code by swapping the model interface accordingly.
