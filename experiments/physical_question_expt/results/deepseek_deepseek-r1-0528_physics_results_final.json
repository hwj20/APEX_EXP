The position vectors are functions of time: r1(t) = r1_initial + v1_initial * t and r2(t) = r2_initial + v2_initial * t. The relative position vector is \u0394r(t) = r2(t) - r1(t), and we solve ||\u0394r(t)|| = 1.0. This leads to a quadratic equation: a t^2 + b t + c = 0, where a = ||\u0394v||^2, b = 2 * (\u0394r_initial \u00b7 \u0394v), c = ||\u0394r_initial||^2 - 1.0, with \u0394r_initial = r2_initial - r1_initial and \u0394v = v2_initial - v1_initial. Calculating the vectors: \u0394r_initial = [3.6553952960990247, 6.052886133174191, 3.2534023229636767] m, \u0394v = [-1.693604777629687, -1.142841345537579, -1.5169229626120792] m/s.

Thus, there are no real roots, meaning no collision occurs. The minimum distance is approximately 3.21 m at t_min \u2248 2.786 s, confirming it exceeds 1.0 m.
