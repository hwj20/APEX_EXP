The vertical component (Vz) can be calculated as Vz = V * sin(theta), and the horizontal components (Vx and Vy) are Vx = V * cos(theta_x) and Vy = V * cos(theta_y). The flight time can be determined using the formula t = 2 * Vz / g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2). The maximum height can be calculated using h = Vz\u00b2 / (2 * g). Finally, the range in the x and y directions can be calculated using dx = Vx * t and dy = Vy * t. After performing the calculations, we find the flight time to be approximately 5.88 seconds, the maximum height to be approximately 7.20 meters, and the ranges to be approximately 75.60 meters in the x-direction, 84.60 meters in the y-direction, and 0 meters in the z-direction since the projectile lands at the same height it was launched.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"flight_time\": \"5.88\",\n        \"maximum_height\": \"7.20\",\n        \"range_x\": \"75.60\",\n        \"range_y\": \"84.60\",\n        \"range_z\": \"0\"\n    }\n}"

Given the radius of 3.59 meters and the time of 8.74 s, we find the angle and then calculate x_B and y_B. The z_B remains 0 since it rotates in the xy-plane. For Object C, we use the equations for projectile motion, where the horizontal position is determined by the initial speed components and the vertical position by the launch angle.

For Object A in linear motion, the final position is calculated using the equation: final position = initial position + initial velocity * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time^2. For Object B in circular motion, the position after a certain time is calculated using the parametric equations for circular motion: x = r * cos(angular velocity * time), z = r * sin(angular velocity * time), and y = 0. For Object C in projectile motion, the position is computed using the initial speed components and the launch angle to find the x, y, and z positions after a certain time, considering gravitational acceleration in the z direction. The calculations yield the following positions: Object A at (49.91, 43.76, 15.88), Object B at (1.62, 0, 2.38), and Object C at (118.29, 178.45, 89.79).\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"pos_A\": {\n            \"x_A\": \"49.91\",\n            \"y_A\": \"43.76\",\n            \"z_A\": \"15.88\"\n        },\n        \"pos_B\": {\n            \"x_B\": \"1.62\",\n            \"y_B\": \"0\",\n            \"z_B\": \"2.38\"\n        },\n        \"pos_C\": {\n            \"x_C\": \"118.29\",\n            \"y_C\": \"178.45\",\n            \"z_C\": \"89.79\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
