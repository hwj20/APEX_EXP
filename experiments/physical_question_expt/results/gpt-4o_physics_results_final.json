The angle of 59.52 degrees is the angle with respect to the x-y plane, which affects the z-component of the velocity. First, we decompose the velocity into its components: Vx = 28.14 m/s, Vy = 18.46 m/s, Vz = 22.99 m/s. The z-component is affected by gravity, so we calculate the time of flight by considering the vertical motion: time of flight = 2 * Vz / g, where g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2. The maximum height is found using the formula h = Vz^2 / (2 * g). The range in x and y directions is calculated using the horizontal components of the velocity and the time of flight: dx = Vx * flight_time, dy = Vy * flight_time.

The initial distance between the centers is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: sqrt((1.9710719902201919 - (-0.5092291574078609))^2 + (1.6579975678562353 - (-0.36365726285249034))^2 + (1.0410562774285246 - (-0.7266541660776429))^2) = 3.647. The sum of the radii is 1.0 (0.5 + 0.5). Since the initial distance is greater than the sum of the radii, they are not initially colliding.

The relative velocity vector is directed towards reducing the distance between the particles, indicating a possibility of collision. We then compute the dot product of the relative position (p2 - p1) and the relative velocity: dot([2.4803011476280528, 2.0216548307087257, 1.7677104435061675], [5.607267352609663, 4.570396276806706, 3.9962990253092014]) = 30.32. Since this dot product is positive, the objects are moving towards each other, confirming a collision will occur.

Therefore, they are not initially colliding. Next, we need to calculate the relative velocity along the line connecting their centers to see if they are moving towards each other. The relative velocity vector is [2.6114987207204794 - 4.786068291730446, 3.238966337786266 - 5.936022087341613, 3.067950781989903 - 5.622603542467189] = [-2.1745695710099666, -2.697055749555347, -2.554652760477286]. The vector connecting their centers is [0.6704637552953902 + 2.1880702520654545, 1.2142925804479288 + 0.16106905726686627, 1.016683665300272 + 2.2135662090036345] = [2.8585340073608447, 1.375361637714795, 3.2302498743039065]. The dot product of these vectors is negative, indicating they are moving towards each other. Therefore, they will collide. For an elastic collision, we use the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy to find the final velocities. The final velocities are calculated using the formula for elastic collisions in three dimensions. After solving, we find the final velocities: Object 1: [3.731, 4.482, 4.217], Object 2: [3.667, 4.693, 4.473].\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"will_collide\": \"true\",\n        \"velocity_1\": {\n            \"vel_1_x\": \"3.731\",\n            \"vel_1_y\": \"4.482\",\n            \"vel_1_z\": \"4.217\"\n        },\n        \"velocity_2\": {\n            \"vel_2_x\": \"3.667\",\n            \"vel_2_y\": \"4.693\",\n            \"vel_2_z\": \"4.473\"\n        }\n    }\n}"

If this distance is less than or equal to the sum of their radii (1.0 m), they are already colliding. The initial positions are P1 = [-2.064819479577558, -1.2387276507656746, -1.4364430002532016] and P2 = [1.99148010197561, 0.38468745720672937, 0.8122512535735293]. The distance between them is calculated using the formula: distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2). Substituting the values, we find the distance is approximately 5.142 m, which is greater than 1.0 m. Therefore, they are not currently colliding. Next, we check if they will collide by analyzing their relative velocity. The relative velocity vector is V_rel = V2 - V1, where V1 = [3.472501594437087, 6.258946971384106, 4.16976864295139] and V2 = [2.217854555391527, 3.9975313689347654, 2.663192551016707].

We then calculate the relative position vector: R_rel = P2 - P1 = [4.056299581553168, 1.623415107972404, 2.2486942538267309]. The dot product of R_rel and V_rel is negative, indicating that the objects are moving towards each other. However, we also need to check if they will reach a distance of 1.0 m. By solving the quadratic equation formed by setting the distance equal to 1.0 m at some time t, we find that the objects will indeed collide. Since it's an elastic collision, we apply the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. The final velocities are calculated using the equations: V1_final = V1 + (2 * m2 / (m1 + m2)) * dot(V_rel, R_rel) / dot(R_rel, R_rel) * R_rel, and V2_final = V2 - (2 * m1 / (m1 + m2)) * dot(V_rel, R_rel) / dot(R_rel, R_rel) * R_rel.
