For Object B, which is in circular motion in the xz-plane, we use the parametric equations for circular motion: x = r*cos(\u03c9t) and z = r*sin(\u03c9t), where r is the radius and \u03c9 is the angular velocity. Since it starts at (r, 0, 0), we calculate its position at the given time. For Object C, which is in projectile motion, we use the kinematic equations separately for each axis, considering no acceleration in the x and z directions and only gravitational acceleration in the y direction. The final positions are calculated based on the given initial velocities and time.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"pos_A\": {\n            \"x_A\": \"46.1753\",\n            \"y_A\": \"102.4236\",\n            \"z_A\": \"18.6625\"\n        },\n        \"pos_B\": {\n            \"x_B\": \"-0.6887\",\n            \"y_B\": \"-0.0\",\n            \"z_B\": \"0.6401\"\n        },\n        \"pos_C\": {\n            \"x_C\": \"83.7094\",\n            \"y_C\": \"168.4153\",\n            \"z_C\": \"-37.212\"\n        }\n    }\n}"

The y-component remains zero as the motion is confined to the xz-plane. Finally, for Object C, which is in projectile motion, we apply the kinematic equations separately for each component. The x and y positions are computed using uniform motion as there is no acceleration in those directions, while the z position is affected by gravitational acceleration (assuming standard gravity of -9.81 m/s\u00b2). We then compare our calculated positions with the provided external predictions to ensure accuracy.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"pos_A\": {\n            \"x_A\": \"-85.0257\",\n            \"y_A\": \"-51.596\",\n            \"z_A\": \"295.1684\"\n        },\n        \"pos_B\": {\n            \"x_B\": \"-1.3312\",\n            \"y_B\": \"-0.0\",\n            \"z_B\": \"3.7083\"\n        },\n        \"pos_C\": {\n            \"x_C\": \"173.6218\",\n            \"y_C\": \"68.8475\",\n            \"z_C\": \"-157.3327\"\n        }\n    }\n}"

For Object A, which is in linear motion, we use the equation of motion: final position = initial position + initial velocity * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time^2. Given initial position is (0,0,0), initial velocity is [6.19, 16.19, 9.3] m/s, acceleration is [-1.0, -0.6, 4.56] m/s\u00b2, and time is 4.05 s, we calculate its final position as follows: x_A = 0 + 6.19 * 4.05 + 0.5 * (-1.0) * (4.05)^2, y_A = 0 + 16.19 * 4.05 + 0.5 * (-0.6) * (4.05)^2, z_A = 0 + 9.3 * 4.05 + 0.5 * 4.56 * (4.05)^2.

For Object B, which is in circular motion, we use the parametric equations for circular motion in the xz-plane: x = r * cos(theta) and z = r * sin(theta), where theta = angular velocity * time. The initial position is (radius, 0, 0), and we compute the new position after the given time. For Object C, we treat it as a projectile motion problem. The position is given by the equations: x = initial velocity_x * time, y = initial velocity_y * time - 0.5 * g * time^2 (assuming y is vertical), and z = initial velocity_z * time. We calculate the positions using these equations and the given initial velocity components and time.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"pos_A\": {\n            \"x_A\": \"79.3151\",\n            \"y_A\": \"20.4188\",\n            \"z_A\": \"129.7032\"\n        },\n        \"pos_B\": {\n            \"x_B\": \"2.0726\",\n            \"y_B\": \"0.0\",\n            \"z_B\": \"3.1012\"\n        },\n        \"pos_C\": {\n            \"x_C\": \"19.5097\",\n            \"y_C\": \"27.3065\",\n            \"z_C\": \"22.8826\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
