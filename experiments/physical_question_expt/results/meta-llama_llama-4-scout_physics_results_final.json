If the distance is less than or equal to the sum of their radii at any point, they will collide. Given that both spheres have a radius of 0.5, the sum of their radii is 1.0. We then calculate their relative position and velocity vectors. The relative position vector is found by subtracting the position of the second object from the first: [-4.97409276796435 - 2.034537257734417, -2.2482371711019167 - 4.6751604929807575, -0.3545015991501108 - 4.391998107571141] = [-7.00863, -6.923397664082674, -4.746499706721252]. The relative velocity vector is [2.896671726631139 - 3.8488929334748927, 2.07283995368775 - 2.754243422416343, 4.3383138016936424 - 5.764445166851845] = [-1.952221206843753, -0.681403468728593, -1.4261313651582026]. The distance between the objects at time t=0 is calculated using the distance formula in 3D space: sqrt((-7.00863)^2 + (-6.923397664082674)^2 + (-4.746499706721252)^2) = sqrt(49.1204 + 47.8933 + 22.5213) = sqrt(119.535) = 10.933. The minimum distance between the two objects can be found using the formula for the distance between two moving points in 3D space, which involves the relative position vector (r0) and relative velocity vector (v_rel) at t=0: d_min = sqrt((r0 . v_rel)^2 - |v_rel|^2 * |r0|^2) / |v_rel|. First, calculate r0 . v_rel = (-7.00863 * -1.952221206843753) + (-6.923397664082674 * -0.681403468728593) + (-4.746499706721252 * -1.4261313651582026) = 13.6873 + 4.7167 + 6.7734 = 25.1774. Then, |v_rel|^2 = (-1.952221206843753)^2 + (-0.681403468728593)^2 + (-1.4261313651582026)^2 = 3.8053 + 0.4643 + 2.0353 = 6.3049. |r0|^2 = 119.535. So, (r0 . v_rel)^2 - |v_rel|^2 * |r0|^2 = (25.1774)^2 - 6.3049 * 119.535 = 633.92 - 753.251 = -119.331. Since (r0 . v_rel)^2 - |v_rel|^2 * |r0|^2 < 0, the objects will not collide if this value is negative, indicating the minimum distance is greater than the sum of their radii.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"will_collide\": \"false\",\n        \"velocity_1\": {\n            \"vel_1_x\": \"2.896671726631139\",\n            \"vel_1_y\": \"2.07283995368775\",\n            \"vel_1_z\": \"4.3383138016936424\"\n        },\n        \"velocity_2\": {\n            \"vel_2_x\": \"3.8488929334748927\",\n            \"vel_2_y\": \"2.754243422416343\",\n            \"vel_2_z\": \"5.764445166851845\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",

The distance between the objects at time t is given by the equation for the distance between two points in 3D space, taking into account their relative position and velocity. However, to check for collision, we use the fact that for an elastic collision, we must calculate the impact parameter and compare it with the radius sum. A more straightforward approach involves directly computing the time of closest approach and checking if at that time, the distance between the two objects is less than or equal to 1 (sum of radii). The time of closest approach can be found from the relative position (r) and velocity (v) as t = - (r \u00b7 v) / |v|^2. If this t is positive and the distance at this t is <= 1, they collide. If they collide, we can use the elastic collision formulae to find the final velocities.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"will_collide\": \"true\",\n        \"velocity_1\": {\n            \"vel_1_x\": \"0.1610619624746975\",\n            \"vel_1_y\": \"1.518096890203429\",\n            \"vel_1_z\": \"2.49110625756724\"\n        },\n        \"velocity_2\": {\n            \"vel_2_x\": \"0.6061436510551419\",\n            \"vel_2_y\": \"-0.5080197763939514\",\n            \"vel_2_z\": \"-0.20671937430160178\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",

Given the initial positions and velocities of the objects, we can calculate their positions as functions of time. Then, we find the time at which the distance between their centers is minimized. If at this time the distance is less than or equal to 1, they collide. For an elastic collision, we use the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy to find the final velocities.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"will_collide\": \"true\",\n        \"velocity_1\": {\n            \"vel_1_x\": \"0.7041073740569731\",\n            \"vel_1_y\": \"0.551249263955467\",\n            \"vel_1_z\": \"1.1063434675469732\"\n        },\n        \"velocity_2\": {\n            \"vel_2_x\": \"-1.563633728253782\",\n            \"vel_2_y\": \"-1.224660340552534\",\n            \"vel_2_z\": \"-3.7121691849930755\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
