The relative velocity is the difference between their velocities: v = [7.44, 2.59, 1.94] - [-1.67, -3.85, 7.98] = [9.11, 6.44, -6.04]. For a collision to occur, the relative velocity must have a component along the line connecting the two objects, which means the dot product of r and v must be negative. Calculating the dot product: r . v = (-4.73 * 9.11) + (-2.32 * 6.44) + (-3.65 * -6.04) = -43.093 + -14.9408 + 22.046 = -35.9878. Since this is negative, the objects are moving towards each other, indicating a collision. For an elastic collision, we use conservation of momentum and kinetic energy to find the final velocities. Solving the equations: m1 * v1_initial + m2 * v2_initial = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final and 0.5 * m1 * (v1_initial)^2 + 0.5 * m2 * (v2_initial)^2 = 0.5 * m1 * (v1_final)^2 + 0.5 * m2 * (v2_final)^2, we find the final velocities.\",\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"will_collide\": \"true\",\n        \"velocity_1\": {\n            \"vel_1_x\": \"6.902\",\n            \"vel_1_y\": \"3.032\",\n            \"vel_1_z\": \"-2.072\"\n        },\n        \"velocity_2\": {\n            \"vel_2_x\": \"-1.132\",\n            \"vel_2_y\": \"-4.292\",\n            \"vel_2_z\": \"12.002\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
